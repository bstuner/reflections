How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff spots directly the line with difference and helps see where the bug might be.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You have stored all the historic and can get back to any previous working version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing when to commit force to be rigourous and conscientious but it implies a lot of liberty.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make a coherent snapshot of the application and track all related changes between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Just git log to see history and git diff id1 id2 to see difference between two id of commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you can always checkout to a previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For version control of my code.
